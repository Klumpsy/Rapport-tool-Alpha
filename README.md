# Rapport-tool-Alpha
Tool I made for a school to make student reports.

First version of this tool (full crud version build with react is on it's way). 

By typing the name in the "name" field the student (if it is present in the database) will be read from the Firebase database. 
The teacher can then add/delete/modify data and save the report again for later use. 

Quick overview of the fields: 

- Student credentials 
- Test scores 
- % sliders (to indicate the progress of going to the next level of a particular skill). 
- Input fields where teachers can write personal messages. 

Once the report is done, the report can be printed in PDF format (document name will be the name of the student automatically). 

In this version there is no option for users to delete students. The next version will have that option.
